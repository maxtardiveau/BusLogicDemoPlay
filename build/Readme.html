<h1>Bus Logic Demo (Play edition)</h1>
	
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This directory contains a copy of ABL's BusLogicDemo project, pre-configured for the Play framework.
<br/>
This is a simple Play application, demonstrating the use of Automated Business Logic's 
transaction logic engine.

<h2>Running the demo app</h2>

This demo can either be run from the command line, or from an IDE.
But regardless, you will need <a href="http://www.playframework.org" target="A">Play 1.2</a> installed and running.
<p/>
You will also need to update the dependencies. Change your current directory to BusLogicDemoPlay and execute:<br/>
<pre>play dependencies --sync</pre>

<h4>From the command line</h4>
To run this demo from the command line, make sure that Play is set up correctly.
Change your current directory to BusLogicDemoPlay and execute:<br/>
<pre>play run</pre>
<p/>
This may take a minute, as Play will download the required libraries.

<h4>From an IDE</h4>

Before you import this project into your IDE, you will need to ask Play to generate the appropriate
project files. To do so, you should change your current directory to BusLogicDemoPlay and execute:
<ul>
	<li><code>play eclipsify</code> for Eclipse
	<li><code>play idealize</code> for IntelliJ
	<li><code>play netbeansify</code> for NetBeans
</ul>
You can then import the project into your IDE.
<p/>
To open this demo project in Eclipse or STS, select <code>File/Import/Existing Project into Workspace</code>
and select the BusLogicDemoPlay directory. IntelliJ and NetBeans have a slightly different procedure, but they seem
to be able to open the project with little difficulty.
<p/>
If you're not sure how to start the application, please refer to 
<a href="http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.4/guide1#aRunningtheapplicationa" target="A">the Play documentation</a>.
